**Definition 4.4.** Let $X, X_1$ and $X_5$ be the sets of maximum affine equiangular sets in $X, X_1$, and $X_5$, respectively, with respect to $r$.

Our aim is to investigate maximum affine equiangular sets $ω$ in $X$ with norm 3 with respect to $r$ up to switching equivalence, that is, replacing some of the vectors $u ∈ ω$ by $r − u$. From the following lemma, we may restrict our attention to affine equiangular sets in $X_1$ and ones in $X_5$.

**Lemma 4.5.** We have $X/ ∼_{sw} = \{|\psi ∪ φ| : [ψ] ∈ X_5/ ∼_{sw}, φ ∈ X_1\}$. In particular, $|X/ ∼_{sw}| = |X_5/ ∼_{sw}| ∩ |X_1|$. \[Proof.\] Let $X_{±1}$ be the set of maximum affine equiangular sets in $X_1$ and $X_{1}$. By (4.6), we have $(u, v) ∈ \{0, 1\}$ for any $u ∈ X_1 ∪ X_{1}$ and $v ∈ X_5$. Hence,'

Then, it suffices to show $[ψ] = [ψ′]$ and $φ = φ′$. Indeed, we obtain $[ψ] = [ψ′]$ and $[φ] = [φ′]$. Moreover, as discussed earlier, since an element of $X_1$ uniquely exists as a representative of $[φ]$, we conclude $φ = φ′$.

5. **Maximum Affine Equiangular Sets in $X_5$**

In this section, we determine a unique maximum affine equiangular set in $X_5$ up to $\text{Aut}(Λ)_r$ with a computer.

**Lemma 5.1.** Every affine equiangular set in $X_5$ with respect to $r$ is of cardinality at most 12.

1) $\mathcal{S}(\pi_0)$ is a finite subset of $((\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1})^n$ and each $\theta \in \mathcal{S}(\pi_0)$ has exactly two entries of $-1$;

2) For every $\theta \in \mathcal{S}(\pi_0)$, the $\theta$-weight space of $H_{\pi_0}^2(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is 1-dimensional with a basis vector represented by a uniquely defined bi-vector field $V_\theta$ on $X$ (see (2.19)).

For $p \in [0, n]$, let $\mathcal{X}^p(X)$ be the space of all algebraic $p$-vector fields on $X$, and let $[,]_{\text{Sch}}$ be the Schouten bracket on $\mathcal{X}(X) = \oplus_{p=0}^n \mathcal{X}^p(X)$. For $W \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ and $p \in [0, n]$, let $\mathcal{X}^p(X)^W$ be the direct sum of the $((\mathbb{C}^\ast)^n$-weight spaces in $\mathcal{X}^p(X)$ with weights in $W$. By definition $\mathcal{X}^p(X)^W = 0$ if $W = \emptyset$.

For a subset $\mathcal{S}$ of $\mathcal{S}(\pi_0)$ and $m \geq 1$, let $\mathcal{S}_{\geq m}$ denote the set of all elements in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ that can be written as the sum of $m$ or more elements in $\mathcal{S}$. We say that $\mathcal{S}$ satisfies Condition (W1) if'

Due to the non-commutativity of the operators on $\mathcal{H}$, the quantum analogue of the FI cannot be uniquely introduced. In fact, there exist several different definitions of quantum Fisher information. The most celebrated and useful approaches are based on the so-called symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) operators $L_\mu^S$ [53] and right logarithmic derivative (RLD) operators $L_\mu^R$ [54, 55], defined as follows'

Moreover, for any other $c' = (c'_\theta \in \mathbb{C}^\ast)_{\theta \in \mathcal{S}}$, the two Poisson structures $\pi^S(c)$ and $\pi^S(c')$ coincide after a re-scaling of the coordinates $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$.

When $\mathcal{S}(\pi_0)$ is itself $C$-linearly independent as a subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$, the $T$-invariant formal power series Poisson deformation $\pi^{S(\pi_0)}(c)$ of $\pi_0$ in (1.3) is said to be **maximal**, and we explain in Theorem 2.22 the precise sense in which it is maximal. Similarly, if $\mathcal{S}(\pi_0)$ satisfies Condition (W1), the $T$-invariant algebraic Poisson deformation $\pi^{S(\pi_0)}(c)$ of $\pi_0$ in (1.4), for any $c = (c_\theta \in \mathbb{C}^\ast)_{\theta \in \mathcal{S}(\pi_0)}$, is said to be **maximal**, and the precise sense in which it is maximal is explained in Theorem 2.34.

We remark that the miracle that the Poisson deformations along $\pi_1^S(c)$ as in Theorem A are unobstructed has been observed in [MPS20] in the context of complex log-symplectic manifolds. While the methods of [MPS20] heavily used the homotopy algebra techniques, such $L_{\infty}$-algebras, our proofs are elementary and our strategies are adopted from [MPS24] where deformations of $q$-symmetric algebras are studied.

Let again $T$ be any complex algebraic torus with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{t}$ and character lattice $X^\ast(T) \subset \mathfrak{t}^\ast$. We define an $n$-dimensional $T$-action datum to be a pair $((\, , \, ), \beta)$, where $((\, , \, ), \beta)$ is a symmetric $C$-bilinear form on $\mathfrak{t}^\ast$, and'
